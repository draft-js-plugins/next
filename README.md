# DISCLAIMER: This project isn't usable yet

This is at an experimental stage, mostly this project isn't complete and ready for use. If you're interested in participating, whether it's code or just debate, please open an issue, hit me up on twitter or the [draft js slack channel](https://draftjs.herokuapp.com/)

# Contributing

## Install project

1. Run `npm install` (we use package-lock.json rather than `yarn`)
2. Run `yarn lerna bootstrap`, this will install all dependencies of all packages and examples.

## Working locally

In order to work on packages and examples at the same time, just run `yarn lerna link` and start `yarn watch` in the package/example folders you want to work on.

## Process

If you'd like to contribute, please follow this process. If you disagree with the process or would like to change it, just open an issue or talk to me [on slack](https://draftjs.herokuapp.com).

1. Plugins go into the `packages` folder. Plugins are basic building blocks, they don't cater to a specific usecase, but should be used as composable building blocks for your draft js app. Generally I'm trying to avoid any styling and leave that up to user land. Usage of render props and inversion of control is encouraged, if you're not sure what I mean, please have a peak at [Kent's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k2YasGFX7o) building [downshift](https://github.com/paypal/downshift).
2. We use [flow](https://flow.org/) for type checking.
3. We use gitbook for documentation, in order to add documentation for a package you're working on, you can just add a readme in the package folder, and link it from the main readme.
4. Examples are our playground for trying out packages we're working out and building out different usecases. standalone `create-react-app` apps found in the examples folder. To add an example, just copy an existing example and modify it to suit your needs.

## Rationale - A component based architecture

Draft js plugins is great. But currently has a bunch of problems, some of which are entirely our own doing, building a plugin system that does more than it should.


1. We have our own state management (sometimes more than 1 version of state management üò¢. This causes a whole class of bugs
2. Plugins have their own custom lifecycle, another class of bugs üò¢ 
3. Composing plugins really sucks üòï (At some point we introduced a `decorator` ‚Äúpattern‚Äù to remedy this, which is super confusing because it has nothing to do with draft js decorators)
4. The API for most of the plugins is too big and growing, making it exponentially hard to maintain and develop further.
5. Plugins aren‚Äôt very `reacty`

Having thought this over for almost a year now I think the best way forward would be to freeze draft js development (support yes, new features no) and start working on a successor with a different architecture: One that is component based.


1. Components already have state üòí 
2. Components already have a lifecycle üòí
3. Components provide great patterns for composition, and everyone who uses react is familiar with at least a handful of these patterns.
4. Using component patterns over massive configuration objects, would make the API much smaller and easier to test, follow, maintain

# Examples:
Now some examples, if you have any questions ideas lmk!

### EditorStateContainer

The EditorContainer would be a container for the editorState, as well as all the properties a draft js Editor can hold.tt

### Mentions

```js
<EditorStateContainer editorState={this.state.editorState} onChange={this.onChange}>
  <Suggestions trigger="@" getSuggestions={this.fetchUsers}/>
  <Editor />
</EditorStateContainer>
```


### Toolbars

In this case we use a text selection popover for a medium style toolbar, but this could be anything

```js
<EditorStateContainer editorState={this.state.editorState} onChange={this.onChange}>
  <TextSelectionPopover>
    <Bold />
    <Italic />
    <Underline />
    <Strikethrough />
  </TextSelectionPopover>
  <Editor />
</EditorStateContainer>
```


### Atomic blocks

```jsx
<EditorContainer>
  <Editor />

  <AtomicBlock type="IMAGE">
    {(props) => <Image {...props} />}
  </AtomicBlock>

  <AtomicBlock type="VIDEO">
    {(props) => <Video {...props} />}
  </AtomicBlock>
</EditorContainer>
```

### File

```jsx
<EditorContainer>
  <Editor />

  <Upload
    onSelectFile={}
  >
    {() => (
      <input type="file" />
    )}
  </Upload>
</EditorContainer>
```
